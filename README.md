# SSLStrip2

SSLStrip2 + all associated research was originally published by [LeonardoNve](https://github.com/LeonardoNve).

This repository was given the shredder (but its git history was not purged - yay) to comply with laws criminalizing the possession and publication of hacking tools. Unfortunately, in order for that to be effective, _all_ governments of the world must agree to ban the publication of hacking tools. Fortunately, the government I live under does not implement that level of control.

This tool has been specifically preserved, as it appeared in BlackHat ASIA 2014 as [OFFENSIVE: EXPLOITING DNS SERVERS CHANGES](http://www.slideshare.net/Fatuo__/offensive-exploiting-dns-servers-changes-blackhat-asia-2014). Whether or not you like BlackHat, it is an influential conference and it'd be a hell of a shame to see any of the research materials disappear.

### Notes

Operating instructions are in the README file, as well as README_ORIGINAL.
